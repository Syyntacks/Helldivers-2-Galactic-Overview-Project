        "content": "[p]Attention, Helldivers! The Ministry of Defense Research & Development team has just declassified the following information for immediate release.\u00a0\n[/p][p]You have been cleared to field test a new range of experimental weapons built from acquired alien technology. R&D scientists have completed the Control Group Premium Warbond* for deployment to your Super Destroyer![/p][p][/p]\n[previewyoutube=L8FKZG2lPBw;full][/previewyoutube]\n\n[p][b]Weapons & Stratagems[/b][/p][p][img src=\"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44156989/0d739b6cba663b47c61717eac2331c9fb47872f0.jpg\"][/img][/p][p]First up, in the primary weapon category, is the VG-70 Variable, a seven-barrelled volley gun with three different firing modes: Auto, which has three selectable RPM values; Volley, which fires a single shot from each barrel at once; and Total, which fires all remaining ammunition in one go. [i]Researchers noted that using the Total firing mode with a lot of ammunition may result in bodily harm to the user.\n[/i][/p][p][img src=\"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44156989/d620b7f5c4b228ae9afac118dec5a83d4f2d9ba4.jpg\"][/img][/p][p]Also in need of field testing is the new G-31 Arc grenade. The lightweight G-31 bounces while discharging electricity that strikes enemies (and Helldivers) in proximity.[/p][p][/p][p][img src=\"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44156989/225acfa48acc6bc4369973ca60d9ddea14bbb67c.jpg\"][/img][/p][p]The next declassified item is the PLAS-45 Epoch support weapon which charges plasma into a focused sphere which is then fired. [i]This weapon is ready for battlefield use, but additional research data suggests that it can explode if overcharged. No safe mode is available[/i]. But we're sure you can handle it, Helldiver. This is what field testing is all about!\n\n[img src=\"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44156989/8143ffa46adfbf833637cd921649f8cb4e9a7a2d.jpg\"][/img][/p][p]Next up in offensive technology is the A/LAS-98 Laser Sentry. For this sentry, the ammunition canisters on standard turrets have been replaced with a supersized heatsink, allowing the potential for infinite laser firing. [i]However, R&D would like to remind users that the turret can overheat and explode if the laser is continuously active with no cooldown.[/i][/p][p][/p][p][img src=\"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44156989/a377332350462d22bda94e11e2a4dbf8f7de5cc9.jpg\"][/img][/p][p]Perhaps the most significant and exciting development from the Ministry of Defense is the new LIFT-182 Warp Pack stratagem. R&D has harnessed the power of Dark Fluid to generate a (somewhat) stable wormhole on demand. Once the wormhole is active, wearers can teleport short distances with no cooldown between jumps. In practice, the wearer is pulled into the singularity, dematerialized, and rematerialized again in a new location.\u00a0[/p][p][/p][p][i]The head of R&D noted that the dematerialization process can be somewhat painful, and that users should bear in mind that the wormhole cannot maintain integrity for extended periods\u2013each jump will further destabilize it, and the wearer may experience death should the singularity fully collapse[/i]. A small price to pay for ultra-convenient traversal![/p][p][/p][p][b]Armors & More[/b][/p][p][img src=\"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44156989/68f7f95799887345ddba4c7f8f9d958b46b5ec06.jpg\"][/img][/p][p]And don\u2019t forget about proper personal protective equipment! Good field testing involves enforcing safety protocols, which is why we\u2019re outfitting Control Group with two new sets of armor designed to provide adequate battlefield protection. For medium armor, we\u2019ve included the AD-26 Bleeding Edge that will allow for protection and greater ease of movement combined. But for more dangerous experiments, there\u2019s also the AD-49 Apollonian heavy armor that\u2019s meant to assist you with the perils of evaluating all this new equipment.\u00a0\n[/p][p]Each armor set looks professionally stylish with the coordinating capes, Conductor of Brilliance and Over Artifice Triumphant, and both armor sets feature a new and exciting passive: Adreno-Defibrillator! After you take lethal damage and the Adreno-Defibrillator detects that the user has collapsed, it activates and revives the user to full health. [i]R&D did indicate that the Adreno-Defibrillator only has enough charge for one use to bring the user to maximum health, and the user will begin losing health continually after activating it.[/i]\n[/p][p]In addition to all this, R&D is including new player cards to match the Conductor of Brilliance and Over Artifice Triumphant capes, and we\u2019re giving you access to a new emote to assist in testing: Protect Eardrums. Covering your ears is the leading method to prevent noise-induced hearing loss. Safety first!\n[/p][p]And, finally, with great scientific discovery comes much hard work and sacrifice, Helldivers, and that\u2019s why we want to recognize your valiant field testing efforts of the Control Group Warbond with a special title: Exemplary Subject. Wear this to show your squad that you got in on the ground floor of this advanced technology!\n[/p][p]You\u2019ve been recruited into the Control Group, divers. Report to R&D for field testing on July 17!\n[/p][p][img src=\"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44156989/0ba76e503f0115cf58183f0b1ce60a8f38d919dd.jpg\"][/img][/p][p]*[i]Requires base game, paid purchase of Super Credits, and game progression to unlock.[/i][/p]",

You are the keeper of the peace and the deliverer of justice, but you need to step up your gear before you go out on patrol. That\u2019s why the Ministry of Defense has approved the release of the Force of Law Premium Warbond1 on June 12![/p][p][/p][previewyoutube=\"uHuOJoeXdYA;full\"][/previewyoutube][p][/p][p]First, let\u2019s talk gear. The AR-32 Pacifier, a large capacity assault rifle, is the last word in defense against enemies roaming the colonies. Combine it with the new G-109 Urchin stun grenade, which attaches to the perp and dispenses electrical pulses until they\u2019re incapacitated, and you can handle any size squid assembly.[/p][p][/p][p][img src=\"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44156989/39c7126a50dcd6bcd2736834fa08759aaf226eb8.jpg\"][/img][/p][p][img src=\"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44156989/5256c256d6d3d700a52094d9f8fe1e335dfec585.jpg\"][/img][/p][p]But hold on\u2013you\u2019re still going to need some backup, diver. We can\u2019t think of a better companion than the AX/ARC-3 \u201cGuard Dog\u201d K-9. Loyal to its core, the arc-powered K-9 will get between you and any threat to your authority. Just be wary of the occasional (accidental) friendly bite.[/p][p][/p][p][img src=\"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44156989/bcbb144fb47ad8350586fe2bafae6bd007853c88.jpg\"][/img][/p][p]We\u2019re also including access to the GL-52 De-Escalator support weapon, a grenade launcher that fires high-powered arc grenades. The negotiations will be short and shocking when you call this one in.[/p][p][/p][p][img src=\"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44156989/2fb70bf342dc98782a1d3e2b6bf9d15a17743acc.jpg\"][/img][/p][p]This isn\u2019t an undercover job, either, so you need to get some gear that lets citizens, SEAF, and squids alike know you\u2019re on the beat. Nothing inspires a sense of safety and obedience quite like the sight of a Helldiver wearing the BP-20 Correct Officer medium armor, with its protective padding and roomy pouches.[/p][p][/p][p]But maybe you want to be first on the scene, which means you need something lightweight. In that case, try the BP-32 Jackboot, a light armor packing fewer pouches, but more panache with an official-looking tailored jacket and sturdy pauldrons.[/p][p][/p][p][img src=\"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44156989/e7ecd746946e3f2ce30910afb98e4642ba26587f.jpg\"][/img][/p][p]Both armors come with the Ballistic Padding passive that grants the wearer higher resistance to chest damage, explosive damage, and all damage from bleeding. These armors also pair well with either the Miranda\u2019s Legacy or the Mother Eagle\u2019s Wings capes, and their matching player cards, in coordinating blue and gold color schemes.[/p][p][/p][p][img src=\"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44156989/012beba489ab720ea460b000bc765d7723fb663b.jpg\"][/img][/p][p]Force of Law also includes new patterns! Watch them scatter when your paddy wagon, the FRV, rolls down the street with the True Blue pattern, also available for your Exosuits and Hellpods. Speaking of Hellpods, be sure to equip the new booster\u2013Stun Pods\u2013which hotwires your drops to shock nearby suspects into a stupor.[/p][p][/p][p][img src=\"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44156989/11db45414ada3b85252a60b4d9c97cdc517e1abf.jpg\"][/img][/p][p]We haven\u2019t forgotten the emotes, either. This Warbond comes with three hand signal emotes for Hold, Silence, and Group Up. Even if the mic is off, you can still organize your unit.[/p][p]And lastly, you\u2019ve got the gun, but now you need the badge. You\u2019ll be able to equip the Extra Judicial title, reserved only for those who protect and serve the citizens of Super Earth.[/p][p][/p][p]Be on the lookout, Helldivers: Force of Law is coming June 12! This Managed Democracy isn\u2019t gonna enforce itself.[/p][p][/p][p][img src=\"{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44156989/c8ae43e297c4ea5940bfcf828a0e15d9ebd52936.jpg\"][/img][/p][p][i]Requires base game, paid purchase of Super Credits, and game progression to unlock.[/i][/p]",

        "content": "Helldivers, get to your Super Destroyers! In a surprise turn of events that even our top researchers couldn\u2019t predict, the Illuminate have finally revealed their intentions, emerging from the Meridian singularity, and setting a course for Super Earth.\n\n[previewyoutube=bO9qCGVQsFs;full][/previewyoutube]\n\nIt\u2019s now more important than ever that we band together and stop this salvo from destroying our liberty.\n\nNew Enemies\nThe Illuminate threat has grown, unleashing new terrors on our citizens across the galaxy. Reports indicate the Illuminate have deployed larger, more powerful enemies within their fleet, among them are the Stingray: jetfighters that provide Illuminate support from the sky, targeting Helldivers and lining up devastating strafing runs. Another new foe is the Crescent Overseer, which has the ability to lay barrages on Helldivers in cover.\n\nBut perhaps most terrifying are the reports of a failed Illuminate experiment called the Fleshmob: a Frankenstein\u2019s monster of Voteless parts turned into a brute battlefield force that the Helldivers must work hard to destroy.\n\nThere have been sightings of other, even larger ships, though details remain unclear on their abilities. But we can\u2019t underestimate the squids, divers, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re assembling our best and brightest to push them back into oblivion where they belong.\n\nWe have to gather all our resources to face this incursion and, fortunately, Super Earth\u2019s R&D department has unlocked some powerful tools for our Helldivers, in the hopes that they will help crush the onslaught of Illuminate invaders.\n\nCustomize Your Loadout\n\nHelldivers are being given access to a robust new weapon customization feature for the bulk of our primary weapon offerings. Most primary weapons now have levels that are achievable by completing missions, which then in turn unlock new attachments obtainable through Requisition. In addition to attachments, players can also unlock patterns for their weapons.\u00a0\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44156989/48bdc2361d090bbdeb018836b6a208c0f1b73c19.png[/img]\n\nWhether it's tweaking sights for precision, changing color patterns, adjusting magazines for ammo capacity, muzzles to optimize weapon performance characteristics or adjusting under-barrel attachments for the handling you want, you're in command of how your weaponry performs on the battlefield. This level of individual attunement is sure to make your favorite primary best in its class.\n\nOld Warbonds, New Patterns\nWe have unlocked and deployed a stash of patterns for the FRV themed on our Viper Commandos, Freedom's Flame, Chemical Agents, and Truth Enforcers Warbonds. These will help your squad stand out to aid in battlefield coordination and collaboration. [b]This backlog of patterns will unlock for Helldivers on May 15, with the launch of the Masters of Ceremony Warbond![/b]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44156989/086ad5db38d420a0982fd909484ab56747c929ac.jpg[/img]\n\nExpanded Surplus\nThe Superstore is also getting an emergency expansion to boost your arsenals for the fight. No more waiting for items to come back into rotation\u2013now the items you want are always available, ready to stock your ship and armor your Helldivers with items you might have missed the first time around.\n\nThe Superstore will have one rotating page featuring six different content sets that changes every 48 hours, shortening the rotation to 12 days. All the earlier Superstore items from older Warbonds are available to purchase anytime. When new Warbonds are released, one of the current rotating sets will be moved to a permanent page.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44156989/c34139153b964d44b48535b188d50f4ce3369679.png[/img]\n\nThis is the moment of truth, Helldivers.

Without further ado lets dive straight in\n\n[previewyoutube=Cca-KKScFKc;full][/previewyoutube]\n\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] New Illuminate faction enemies\n[*] New Weapon Customizations and Progression\n[*] Crash fixes\n[*] Weapon fixes\n[*] Miscellaneous fixes\n[/list]\n[h2]Major Update[/h2]\n[b]Weapon Customization[/b]\nGear up, Helldivers\u2014your arsenal just got personal! \nWith the new Weapon Customization system, you can now tailor your favorite weapons to match your combat style and preferences once you\u2019ve progressed and unlocked different attachments. Whether it's tweaking sights for precision, changing color patterns, adjusting magazines for ammo capacity, muzzles to optimize weapon performance characteristics or adjusting underbarrels for the handling you want, you're in command of how your weaponry performs on the battlefield. \nTinker in the menu, customize your specific weapon configs and switch between them during the mission loadout sequence.\nIt's time to fight for Super Earth with weapons that are truly yours!\n\n[previewyoutube=A7TURE5p5Ik;full][/previewyoutube]\n\n[b]We are aware of a bug that prevents players from canceling customization with a controller. We have a fix identified and prepared for our next hotfix. In the meantime, you can save the customization and then go in and do it again.[/b]\n\n[h2]New Illuminate Enemies[/h2]\n[b]Stingray: [/b]\nJetfighters that provide Illuminate support from the sky, targeting Helldivers and lining up devastating strafing runs.\n\n[b]Crescent Overseer: [/b]\nHas the ability to lay barrages on Helldivers in cover.\n\n[b]Fleshmob:[/b]\nA failed Illuminate experiment made up of Voteless parts turned into a brute battlefield force that the Helldivers must work hard to destroy.\n\n[h2]Balancing[/h2]\n[b]Weapon balances:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Spread\n[*] Drag\n[*] Sway\n[*] Melee weapons stamina cost\n[*] Shrapnel spawning\n[*] Fire damage\n[/list]\n[b]Spread:[/b]\nSpread refers to how much a projectile veers from the point you're aiming at when you fire. This rebalance primarily targets SMGs and sidearms, which previously had noticeably higher spread values. We've reviewed all primary, sidearm, and support weapons with the intent to significantly reduce spread overall, as it didn\u2019t make much sense for these specific weapons to have such high inaccuracy.\n\n[b]Drag:[/b]\nDrag determines how quickly a projectile loses speed over distance, affecting its damage. We've increased drag for pistol-caliber ammunition (used in SMGs and some sidearms) to better represent its shorter, wider projectile compared to rifle rounds. As a result, these weapons will be slightly less effective at longer ranges.\n\n[b]Sway:[/b]\nSway refers to how much the weapon's aim shifts, influenced by factors like movement and stance. It represents the weapon's inertia and stability\u2014so weapons with lower ergonomics will experience less sway, while those with higher ergonomics will have more. Sidearms will naturally have more sway than primaries due to the lack of support features like stocks. This balance patch specifically focuses on adjusting sway for primaries and sidearms.\n\n[b]Stamina Cost:[/b]\nAll melee weapons now consume less stamina when attacking, reducing the cost from 0.1 to 0.05. This change makes melee combat less punishing and allows for easier repositioning between strikes. The affected weapons include the CQC-30 Stun Baton, CQC-19 Stun Lance, CQC-5 Combat Hatchet, and the Entrenchment Tool.\n\n[b]Shrapnel spawning:[/b]\nWith this update, shrapnel will now always spawn in a full 360-degree spread, regardless of where the explosion occurs. This means weapons like the R-36 Eruptor will now more reliably hit the intended target with their shrapnel.\nIn addition, we\u2019ve adjusted shrapnel performance against armor. Shrapnel now has reduced effectiveness at poor impact angles, to reflect its lack of design for armor penetration in such situations.\n\nThese shrapnel balance changes will impact the following weapons:\n[list]\n[*] R-36 Eruptor\n[*] G-6 Frag Grenade\n[*] AC-8 Autocannon\n[/list]\n\n[b]Balance Changes:[/b]\nArmor Penetration decreased on shrapnel projectiles from 3-3-3-0 to 3-3-2-0\n[list]\n[*] Each of these numbers represent an angle threshold, which means we\u2019ve reduced the AP value of 3 to 2 in the last range where a shrapnel projectile would penetrate an enemy.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Frag Grenade[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Increased Shrapnel spawned from 30 to 35\n[/list]\n[b]Autocannon Flak[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Increased Shrapnel spawned from 25 to 30\n[/list]\n\n[b]Fire and Flamethrowers:[/b]\nThis update aims to better balance fire damage between direct hits (like those from flamethrowers) and burn effects over time, while also introducing scaling of fire damage depending on the size of the enemy. Previously, burn damage didn\u2019t scale well against larger enemies, making putting them on fire feel less effective in those encounters.\n\nNow, the larger the enemy, the more damage they take while burning. However, bigger enemies will also be slightly more resistant to ignition. Additionally, direct fire damage now scales with enemy size\u2014so large enemies like Chargers will still take roughly the same damage as before, while smaller enemies will take slightly less.\n\nWe have also increased the magazine capacity of the FLAM-66 Torcher and the FLAM-40 Flamethrower because putting stuff on fire is fun!\n\nDamage:\n[list]\n[list]\n[*] Burning damage now scales with enemy size and will do more damage over time to larger enemies\n[*] Fire direct damage also scales with enemy size. The base damage of direct fire hits has been lowered as compensation. This means that large enemies will take roughly the same amount of damage as before, while smaller enemies will take slightly less\n[/list]\nTime to ignite:\n[list]\n[*] Larger enemies now take longer to ignite\n[*] Robotic enemies are harder to set on fire than organic ones\n[*] Incendiary Ammunition and Lasers are now less effective at igniting enemies, but once they do, the resulting burn damage is more impactful thanks to the new scaling system\n[/list]\nThe Helldiver:\n[list]\n[*] The Helldiver is now slightly more resistant to being set on fire\n[*] Burn damage taken by the Helldiver remains unchanged\n[/list]\n[b]Primary weapons[/b]\nAR-23 Liberator\n[list]\n[*] Spread decreased from 4 to 2\n[/list]\nAR-23P Liberator Penetrator\n[list]\n[*] Starting magazines increased from 5 to 6\n[*] Max spare magazines increased from 7 to 8\n[/list]\nAR-23C Liberator Concussive\n[list]\n[*] Spread decreased from 24 to 4\n[/list]\nStA-52 Assault Rifle\n[list]\n[*] Spread decreased from  4 to 2\n[/list]\nAR-23A Liberator Carbine\n[list]\n[*] Spread decreased from  4 to 3\n[/list]\nAR-61 Tenderizer\n[list]\n[*] Spread decreased from 4 to 1\n[/list]\nSMG-37 Defender\n[list]\n[*] Spread decreased from 20 to 5\n[*] Drag increased from 0.3 to 0.6\n[*] Sway increased from 1 to 1.2\n[/list]\nSMG-72 Pummeler\n[list]\n[*] Spread decreased from 20 to 5\n[*] Drag increased from 0.3 to 0.6\n[*] Sway increased from 1 to 1.2\n[/list]\nMP-98 Knight\n[list]\n[*] Spread decreased from 25 to 5\n[*] Drag increased from 0.3 to 0.6\n[*] Sway increased from 1 to 1.2\n[/list]\nStA-11 SMG\n[list]\n[*] Spread decreased from 25 to 5\n[*] Drag increased from 0.3 to 0.6\n[*] Sway increased from 1 to 1.2\n[/list]\nSMG-32 Reprimand\n[list]\n[*] Spread decreased from 40 to 5\n[*] Drag increased from 0.3 to 0.6\n[/list]\nJAR-5 Dominator\n[list]\n[*] Sway decreased from 1 to 0.8\n[/list]\nR-63CS Diligence Counter Sniper\n[list]\n[*] Sway decreased from 1 to 0.8\n[/list]\nFLAM-66 Torcher\n[list]\n[*] Magazine capacity increased by 25%\n[/list]\nR-36 Eruptor\n[list]\n[*] Spread decreased from 10 to 5\n[*] Ergonomics increased from -14 to 25\n[*] Sway decreased from 1 to 0.8\n[*] Fire rate increased from 25 to 32\n[*] Fixed a bug that allowed players to cancel the Eruptor's round cycling animation, effectively increasing its fire rate\n[/list]\nThe intent with these changes: \n[list]\n[*] The improvements made to the Eruptor are designed to compensate for the removal of the reload exploit, ensuring that its overall power remains steady or even improved\n[/list]\nPLAS-39 Accelerator Rifle\n[list]\n[*] Drag decreased from 1.5 \u2192  0.1\n[*] Is now categorized as an energy weapon in the loadout menu\n[/list]\nThe changes to drag means it wont lose speed and damage as it travels through the air and does the damage you would expect it to do\n\n[b]Sidearm Weapons[/b]\nGP-31 Ultimatum\n[list]\n[*] Is now affected by the Hellpod Optimization Booster\n[*] Explosion damage increased from 1000 to 2000\n[*] Explosion inner radius decreased from 4 to 2 m\n[*] Projectile damage decreased from 3500 to 1000\n[*] Demolition strength decreased from 50 to 40 \n[*] Sway increased from 1 to 1.3\n[/list]\nThe intent with these changes:\n[list]\n[*] We want to maintain the Ultimatum's overall power level while rebalancing how that power is delivered\u2014shifting more of the damage from the projectile itself to the explosion. Previously, the Ultimatum behaved more like a massive kinetic projectile (similar to the 380mm shell) because of its high projectile damage and relatively weaker explosion. This update reinforces its intended identity as a powerful explosive weapon, emphasizing high explosive damage over impact force\n[*] Most heavy enemies will now die from a close hit instead of a direct hit, except for the Factory Strider\n[*] Additionally, due to its reduced demolition strength, the Ultimatum will no longer destroy Stratagem Jammer Objectives or landed Illuminate Warp Ships through their shields. However, the dropships now have health, allowing the Ultimatum to destroy them once the shield is down\n[/list]\nP-2 Peacemaker\n[list]\n[*] Decreased Spread from 30 to 10\n[*] Sway increased from 1 to 1.2\n[/list]\nP-19 Redeemer\n[list]\n[*] Decreased Spread from 35 to 10\n[*] Sway increased from 1 to 1.2\n[/list]\nP-113 Verdict\n[list]\n[*] Decreased Spread from 30 to 8\n[*] Sway increased from 1 to 1.2\n[/list]\nPLAS-15 Loyalist\n[list]\n[*] Decreased Spread from 25 to 10\n[*] Sway increased from 1 to 1.2\n[/list]\nLAS-58 Talon\n[list]\n[*] Sway increased from 1 to 1.2\n[/list]\nP-72 Crisper\n[list]\n[*] Sway increased from 1 to 1.2\n[/list]\nGP-31 Grenade Pistol\n[list]\n[*] Sway increased from 1 to 1.2\n[/list]\nLAS-7 Dagger\n[list]\n[*] Sway increased from 1 to 1.2\n[/list]\nP-11 Stim Pistol\n[list]\n[*] Sway increased from 1 to 1.2\n[/list]\nSG-22 Bushwhacker\n[list]\n[*] Sway increased from 1 to 1.3\n[/list]\nP-4 Senator\n[list]\n[*] Decreased Spread from 30 to 8\n[*] Sway increased from 1 to 1.3\n[/list]\n\n[b]Stratagems[/b]\nRS-422 Railgun\n[list]\n[*] Decreased Spread from 10 to 0.1\n[/list]\nFLAM-40 Flamethrower\n[list]\n[*] Magazine capacity increased by 30%\n[/list]\nBackpacks\nLIFT-850 Jump pack\n[list]\n[*] Increased break force on landing to make Helldivers less likely to ragdoll when landing\n[/list]\nEagles\nEagle 110mm rockets\n[list]\n[*] Stagger strength increased from 35 to 40\n[*] Increased armor penetration in certain angles\n[/list]\n\n[b]Enemies[/b]\nAutomatons\n[list]\n[*] Bunker Turret\n[*] Spread increased from 20 to 50\n[/list]\nConflagration Devastator\n[list]\n[*] Reduced damage per pellet\n[*] More pellets are now required to hit you to put you on fire\n[/list]\nAutomaton Gunship\n[list]\n[*] Body armor value reduced from 4 to 3\n[*] Main body health increased to 950 from 700\n[*] Now shoots more and the aim is slightly more accurate\n[/list]\nBulk Fabricator\n[list]\n[*] Health increased from 1500 to 5000\n[/list]\nConscripts\n[list]\n[*] There was a bug where the Conscripts reloaded after every shot, it\u2019s now been fixed so they only reload when they\u2019re actually out of ammo\n[/list]\nTerminids\nSpore Spewers\n[list]\n[*] Demolition level decreased from 60 to 50, making it easier to kill with heavy ordnance weapons\n[/list]\nIlluminates\n[list]\n[*] Landed Warp Ships\n[*] Will now be easier to kill with Anti-Tank weaponry once the shields are down\n[/list]\n[h2]Fixes[/h2]\n[b]Crash Fixes, Hangs and Soft-locks:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed a crash which could occur when returning to your Super Destroyer from a host parked at a planet with the Democracy Space Station in orbit, if the Democracy Space Station had just moved to a new planet\n[*] Fixed a crash when writing a specific sequence of text in the chat\n[*] Fixed a crash that could occur after partially destroying an Automaton convoy\n[*] Fixed crash when attempting to drop into a mission on Tien Kwan\n[/list]\n[b]Weapons and Stratagems[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The SMG-37 Defender does not trigger the anti tank mines anymore\n[*] Improved the effectiveness of flashlight attachments\n[*] Fixed a bug that was causing the camera to be stuck in Aim Down Sights (ADS) mode when discarding the MLS-4X Commando when utilizing that camera mode\n[*] Cancelling laser weapon reloads no longer gives them infinite ammo\n[/list]\n[b]Miscellaneous Fixes[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Fixed an issue with intermittent flickering of distant visual effects\n[*] Fixed an issue where the FRV and Helldivers embarked in it would get covered in blood after a Helldiver would attack the FRV from any passenger seat\n[*] Spore Scavengers can now properly attack\n[*] Vehicles now correctly show the appropriate enemy blood colors\n[*] Lowered the target node for the Illuminate tesla tower so that the StA-X3 W.A.S.P.
